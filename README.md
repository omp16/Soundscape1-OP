Summer Night

Intro

My soundscape is meant to elicit the feeling of being cozy inside while a storm peacefully falls on a summer night. The beginning half is meant to be rain lightly falling, with sounds reminiscent of Pennsylvania, specifically, including an audio clip of cicadas recorded in Centralia, Pa. When the cicadas return, it once again feels like true summer. I included an audio of tree frogs very quietly croaking. Hearing frogs in the distance always gives me a warm feeling of comfort. As humans stress and struggle with societal issues, the animals in nature exist the same as they have for thousands of years. The idea in general came to me from an episode of Adventure Time titled “Summer Showers”, season 7, episode 16. I downloaded an mp3 file clipped from this episode of a character, Viola, performing in a play. I wanted to include this audio as an ode to Adventure Time. After the dialogue, the audio switches to a heavier rain as a drum beat fades in. Overall, I want the project to be reminiscent of a summer storm drowning out any outside noise and cartoons playing on the tv. A summer night like this is when I feel most comfortable, and I hope to express that feeling. No matter what we experience in our day-to-day lives it’s always important to stay grounded. The combination of natural sounds and synthetic instrumentals reflects the cross between the world of nature and of the human experience, filled with man-made creations. We live in the area between synthetic and real - natural and artificial. There is beauty and comfort in both the world humans have made for ourselves and the earth’s persistence outside of intervention.
